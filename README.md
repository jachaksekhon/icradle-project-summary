# iCradle Project

## Overview

iCradle is a collaborative research project developed in partnership with Kingâ€™s College London. The project focuses on building a scalable and secure platform for data collection and visualization, supporting both web and mobile clients in healthcare environments.

The system was designed with a modern full-stack architecture, leveraging containerization and cross-platform mobile development to ensure flexibility and performance.
